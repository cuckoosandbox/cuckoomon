Directories:
======
* cuckooenvironment: The tests must be executed in a cuckoo virtual machine (Like a malware analysis). For example some checks about agent.py or checks about the human interaction.

* functionality: The tests for a funcionality, for example: testing the hook engine.

* others: Other kind of test, for example tests without a possible automation using the return.

Rules for tests:
======
* Add in the source header a description with: 

** The purpose of the test.
** Why this test is necessary? 

* Return value: A successful tests completion must be return 0. Otherwise return 1.  

* The test must be return ALWAYS (exception for the "others category") to automate the testing process. This is useful using software like jenkins. 

** For example one test make a big Sleep to test the "cuckoom sleep bypass": 
*** Make a thread in the process. This thread checks if the Sleep is skipped or not. 
*** If the Sleep is not skipped in 1 minute the thread can be terminate the process with return value 1.

* The test must be compile with Mingw.

* Use the Makefile If possible. If you need a special Makefile for a test: add a "mingw-make compatible" Makefile.

* Dont repeat an existent test. Maybe you can improve one.

* Use stderr to print errors.
